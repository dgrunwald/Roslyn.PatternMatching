	/// PerformMatch() may save backtracking-savepoints to the ListMatch instance.
	/// Each backtracking-savepoints is a Stack{int} with instructions of how to restore the saved state.
	/// When a savepoint is created by a PerformMatch() call, that call may be nested in several other PerformMatch() calls that operate on
	/// the same list.
	/// When leaving those calls (whether with a successful match or not), the outer PerformMatch() calls may push additional state onto
	/// all of the added backtracking-savepoints.
	/// When the overall list match fails but savepoints exists, the most recently added savepoint is restored by calling PerformMatch()
	/// with listMatch.restoreFrom set to that savepoint. Each PerformMatch() call must pop its state from the savepoint
	/// This state is popped again when resuming from the checkpoint.
