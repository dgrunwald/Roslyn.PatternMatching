Roslyn.PatternMatching
======================

Pattern matching library for Microsoft.CodeAnalysis (Roslyn)

The idea of this project is to support something like [NRefactory pattern matching](https://github.com/icsharpcode/NRefactory/blob/master/doc/Pattern%20Matching.html) for the Roslyn SyntaxTree.
